# Week 10 -- 6 Apr 2021

## Assignment

Start with the Colab notebook from the last class that introduced the MNIST 8-by-8 digits...

1. Create a silhouette plots for the result obtained in class.
2. Perform PCA of the digits, and get projection for the 2 major components.
    * Comment on the dimensionality of the data
3. Repeat the K-means analysis using only the dominant 2 components. 
    * Compare the results to the analysis in #1, using unfiltered data.
    * Plot the decision boundaries for this 2-dimensional problem.
4. Repeat the analysis in ch12.ipynb using the 8-by-8 MNIST digits.
