# Week 14 -- (4 May 2020)

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), with a touch of Reinforcement Learning

### Projects

* The first half of class will be a quick quiz and discussion of GANs and reinforcement learning.
* The last half of the class will be a quick review of projects, with Q/A as needed.
    * Be ready to provide a UMBC-shareable link to the latest draft the Colab notebook for your final project.
    * We'll check to be sure that I can to run your notebook to completion in a few minutes (or less).
    * NOTE: There is **no** expectation that your project will be complete on 4 May.
    * Rather, this is an opportunity for you to get feedback/guidance before final submission on 18 May.
* Remember: Project presentations are May 11th
    * 8- to 10-minute project presentations will occur during class time (not final exam time) on 11 May
* Remember: Final projects (colab notebooks) are due on or before May 18th
    * I'll create an assignment where you can post a link to your notebook.
