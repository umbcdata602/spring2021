# Week 11 -- (13 Apr 2021)

* [This document](https://github.com/umbcdata602/howtos/blob/master/colab.md) has instructions for loading data into Colab.

## Assignment

Cells 1-10 in [ch13b_part2.ipynb](https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book-3rd-edition/blob/master/ch13/ch13_part2.ipynb) show how to use tensorflow to fit a least-squares line.
Adapt the code to use the following data.

```
y_train = np.array([1.0, 3.3, 4.1, 6.0, 8.3, 6.3, 7.6, 6.4, 7.0, 6.5])
```

## Reading and Study Guide

* Rasckha & Mirjalili, Chapter 13
    * Familiarize yourself with [ch13_part1.ipynb](https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book-3rd-edition/blob/master/ch13/ch13_part1.ipynb).
    * Familiarize yourself with [ch13_part2.ipynb](https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book-3rd-edition/blob/master/ch13/ch13_part2.ipynb).
    * Some questions on the quiz will refer to these two notebooks.
    * Some questions on the quiz will also refer to the assignment above.
* Raschka & Mirjalili, Chapter 14
    * Skim the reading in Chapter 14 on Tensorflow 1
    * And skim the final section in Chapter 14 on Tensorflow Estimators
    * There are 3 noteboooks associated with Chapter 14
    * We'll work with these in class but no quiz questions will involve Chapter 14 notebooks.
