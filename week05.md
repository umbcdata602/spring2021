# Week 5 -- Model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning (23 Feb)

In class, we'll investigate each of the classification models in Chapter 3, demonstrating and discussing:

Class discussions will involve working with code from the notebooks associated with Chapter 5 & 6.
You should be familiar with the code in 
[ch05.ipynb](https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book-3rd-edition/blob/master/ch05/ch05.ipynb) 
and [ch06.ipynb](https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book-3rd-edition/blob/master/ch06/ch06.ipynb), 
and able to run these notebooks in Colab.
