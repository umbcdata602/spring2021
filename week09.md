# Week 9 -- Clustering (30 Mar 2021)

## Reading

* Rasckha & Mirjalili, Chapter 11

## Assignment

Beginning with https://github.com/umbcdata602/spring2021/blob/master/week08.ipynb,

1. Perform linear regression on log10(price) and log10(carat) -- do not use train/test splits on the data.
    * How does performance compare to linear scales?
    * Plot the model and the data
    * Plot the residuals
2. Visualize the residuals from step #1 with box (whisker) plots. 
    * Create one boxplot for each categorical value of color
    * Do the same for cut
    * Do the same for clarity
3. Using log scales for price and carat, perform linear regression with all the features in the data
    * For categorical data, you'll have to use one-hot encoding.
    * How does performance compare to the model in step 1?

It's okay to work in teams.  Assignments will not be collected. 
However, some quiz questions will be based on the assignment. 
So it will be a good idea to have your own copy of the assignment solution.
And we'll discuss the answers in class.

## Study guide

* The quiz will be based on the assignment (above), Chapter 11 reading, and ch11.ipynb
* Familiarize yourself with [ch11.ipynb](https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book-3rd-edition/blob/master/ch11/ch11.ipynb).
