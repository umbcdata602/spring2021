# Projects

* Projects are designed to get you to research existing literature.
    * You should learn something new, practice what you learn and explain it in your own words.
    * Choose something of interest to you and strive to make it interesting for your classmates.
    * You must use publicly available data.
* You can work in groups of 2-3.  Let me know if you want to work independently.
* Important dates:
    * 23 March -- Proposals
        * Title and 1-paragraph project proposal from each team
        * Presented and discussed during first class following spring break (2-3 minutes each team)
        * Presented on a shared screen (1 or 2 slides okay)
    * 30 March -- Datasets
        * Colab notebook that reads the primary dataset
        * Presented and discussed in class -- (2-3 minutes for each team)
    * 18 May (possibly 11 May)
        * Each group shall make an in-class presentation of 8-10 minutes during class/final exam time.
        * Each team will provide a shared Colab notebook, due at the time of the presentation.

## Requirements

* The project must be self contained in a Google Colab notebook linked to your UMBC account.
* Anyone with a UMBC account should be able to run the notebook with its data in Colab without errors.
* Notebooks should run to completion in a couple minutes. If necessary, provide saved intermediate results.
* Notebooks should be heavily referenced and code should be well documented.
* Make generous use of data visualizations, use markdown cells to describe/discuss visualizations.

## Content

* Project ideas
    * Data -- the biggest challenge may be finding an appropriate, well-curated dataset
        * You are free to find your own dataset, but it must be publicly accessible and well documented.
        * Look here for ideas: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php
    * Topics -- proposal should have a short (1 paragraph) description of your project goal or hypothesis.
    * You can investigate a new dataset with techniques that we covered in class.
    * You can explore a new technique that we didn't cover in class.
* Notebooks should describe (in your own words) what you learned along the way.
    * Keep your notebooks concise and easily readable.
    * Include an introduction that describes your goals when choosing your project topic.
    * Describe any problems you encountered and the approach you took to solve them.
    * Describe your thought process as you worked to understand difficult/new concepts.
    * Provide short explanatory examples/demos when you want to that clarify more complex issues.
    * Include a 1-paragraph discussion/conclusion section.
* USE REFERENCES: It should be clear throughout your notebook where you got any data, code & ideas.
    * Use only open data sources that are freely accessible on the Internet. Include links.
    * All discussion should be in separate text cells with markdown.
    * Introduce analysis and ideas in text cells with markdown.
    * All code cells should be documented with inline comments.
    * Complex algorithms and code snipppets should be documented concisely within code cells.

## Recommendations

* Start early, don't wait until the last minute.
    * I'll try to respond to questions quickly (less than 72 hours).
    * As the term rolls to an end, it may become harder for me to respond in a timely manner. 
    * Time your presentation -- 8-10 minutes is not a lot of time.
* Ask questions
    * I will be available to comment on drafts and questions.
    * Send me email with a link to your notebook.
    * Make your question/issue easy to find in your notebook.
